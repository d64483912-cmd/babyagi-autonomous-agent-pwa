## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- pnpm (recommended) or npm

### Installation

1. **Clone or navigate to the project directory**
   ```bash
   cd babyagi-pwa
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   # or
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   # or
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

### Available Scripts

- `pnpm dev` - Start development server
- `pnpm build` - Build for production
- `pnpm build:prod` - Build for production (optimized)
- `pnpm preview` - Preview production build
- `pnpm lint` - Run ESLint
- `pnpm clean` - Clean node_modules and lock file

## Configuration

### PWA Setup

The app is configured as a Progressive Web App with:
- Service worker for offline functionality
- Web app manifest for installation
- Automatic updates
- Mobile-optimized interface

### Tailwind CSS

Custom theme with:
- BabyAGI brand colors
- Dark mode support
- Custom animations
- Responsive design utilities

### OpenRouter Integration (Optional)

To enable real AI responses:

1. Get an API key from [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/)
2. Go to Settings in the app
3. Enter your API key and select a model
4. Enable "Use OpenRouter" toggle

**Note**: Costs may apply. The app will fall back to simulation if the API is unavailable.

## Usage

### Basic Workflow

1. **Create an Objective**: Define what you want the AI agent to accomplish
2. **Start Simulation**: Watch as the agent breaks down your objective into tasks
3. **Monitor Execution**: Track task progress and agent learning
4. **Analyze Results**: Review statistics and memory insights
5. **Iterate**: Create new objectives based on learnings

### Features

- **Task Decomposition**: Agents automatically break complex objectives into manageable tasks
- **Dependency Management**: Tasks can depend on other tasks being completed first
- **Learning System**: Agents remember successful strategies and apply them to future tasks
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Watch simulations unfold with live updates
- **Performance Analytics**: Track efficiency, completion rates, and learning progress

## Architecture

### State Management (Zustand)

The app uses Zustand for lightweight, performant state management:

```typescript
// Example store usage
const { objectives, addObjective, startSimulation } = useBabyAGIStore();

// Subscribe to changes
useBabyAGIStore.subscribe(
  (state) => state.simulation,
  (simulation) => {
    // React to simulation state changes
  }
);
```

### BabyAGI Engine

The core simulation engine handles:
- Objective decomposition
- Task execution
- Learning and memory management
- Strategy adaptation

### Type Safety

Full TypeScript coverage with comprehensive interfaces for:
- Objectives and tasks
- Agent memory
- Simulation state
- Settings and configuration
- API responses
